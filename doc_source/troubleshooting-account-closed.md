# My AWS account is closed, suspended, or terminated, and my domain is registered with Route 53<a name="troubleshooting-account-closed"></a>

If you closed your AWS account, or if the account is suspended or terminated, Route 53 doesn't automatically renew your domain registration even if automatic renewal is turned on\. You can contact AWS Support and ask them for help with the following options:
+ If you don't want to keep the domain registration, AWS Support can disable automatic renewal for the domain\. This prevents you from getting several reminder emails about domain renewal\.
+ If you do want to keep the domain registration, AWS Support can help you transfer the domain registration to another AWS account\.
+ AWS Support can also help you transfer the domain to another domain registrar\.
