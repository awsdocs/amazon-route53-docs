# Using health checks with Amazon Route 53 API versions earlier than 2012\-12\-12<a name="dns-failover-using-old-apis"></a>

Health checks are supported starting with the 2012\-12\-12 version of the Amazon Route 53 API\. If a hosted zone contains records that health checks are configured for, we recommend that you use only the 2012\-12\-12 API or later\. Note the following restrictions on using health checks with earlier API versions\.
+ The `ChangeResourceRecordSets` action cannot create or delete records that include the `EvaluateTargetHealth`, `Failover`, or `HealthCheckId` elements\.
+ The `ListResourceRecordSets` action can list records that include these elements, but the elements are not included in the output\. Instead, the `Value` element of the response contains a message that says the record includes an unsupported attribute\.
