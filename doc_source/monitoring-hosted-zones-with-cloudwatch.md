# Monitoring hosted zones using Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-hosted-zones-with-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor your public hosted zones by using Amazon CloudWatch to collect and process raw data into readable, near real\-time metrics\. Metrics are available shortly after Route 53 receives the DNS queries that the metrics are based on\. CloudWatch metric data for Route 53 hosted zones has a granularity of one minute\.

## CloudWatch metric for Route 53 public hosted zones<a name="cloudwatch-metrics-route-53-hosted-zones"></a>

The `AWS/Route53` namespace includes the following metric for Route 53 hosted zones:

**DNSQueries**  
For all the records in a hosted zone, the number of DNS queries that Route 53 responds to in a specified time period\.  
Valid statistics: Sum, SampleCount  
Units: Count  
Region: Route 53 is a global service\. To get hosted zone metrics, you must specify US East \(N\. Virginia\) for the Region\. 

**DNSSECInternalFailure**  
Value is 1 if any object in the hosted zone is in an INTERNAL\_FAILURE state\. Otherwise, value is 0\.  
Valid statistics: N/A  
Units: Count  
Volume: 1 per hosted zone every 4 hours  
Region: Route 53 is a global service\. To get hosted zone metrics, you must specify US East \(N\. Virginia\) for the Region\.

**DNSSECKeySigningKeysNeedingAction**  
Number of key signing keys \(KSKs\) that have an ACTION\_NEEDED state \(due to KMS failure\)\.  
Valid statistics: Sum, SampleCount  
Units: Count  
Volume: 1 per hosted zone every 4 hours  
Region: Route 53 is a global service\. To get hosted zone metrics, you must specify US East \(N\. Virginia\) for the Region\. 

**DNSSECKeySigningKeyMaxNeedingActionAge**  
Time elapsed since the key signing key \(KSK\) was set to the ACTION\_NEEDED state\.  
Valid statistics: N/A  
Units: Seconds  
Volume: Up to 1 per hosted zone, per day  
Region: Route 53 is a global service\. To get hosted zone metrics, you must specify US East \(N\. Virginia\) for the Region\. 

**DNSSECKeySigningKeyAge**  
The time elapsed since the key signing key \(KSK\) was created \(not since it was activated\)\.  
Valid statistics: N/A  
Units: Seconds  
Volume: 1 per hosted zone, per day  
Region: Route 53 is a global service\. To get hosted zone metrics, you must specify US East \(N\. Virginia\) for the Region\. 

## CloudWatch dimension for Route 53 public hosted zone metrics<a name="cloudwatch-dimensions-route-53-hosted-zones"></a>

Route 53 metrics for hosted zones use the `AWS/Route53` namespace and provide metrics for `HostedZoneId`\. To get the number of DNS queries, you must specify the ID of the hosted zone in the `HostedZoneId` dimension\.
